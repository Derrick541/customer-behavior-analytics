# Customer Behavior Analytics

This project simulates customer transaction analysis based on real-world patterns observed during my work as a Student Supervisor at Cornell's Mann Café. I frequently analyzed sales data to forecast demand and optimize inventory, this project extends that work using Python and Jupyter to explore broader trends in customer behavior.

---

## Project Goal

To analyze transaction-level customer data to:
- Understand spending distributions
- Detect high-value customers
- Explore correlations (e.g., demographic-like proxies such as height)
- Simulate internal decision reports used in real-world café operations

---

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git/GitHub

## Insights Summary
- Average customer spend is **$127.22**, mostly between **$119.90–$136.10**
- Highest spending customer: **$158.96**, lowest: **$97.90**
- Spending follows a **right-skewed distribution**, with more low- to mid-spenders
- Slight positive trend between height and spend, but not strong
- Supports segmentation into **low-, mid-, and high-value** customers for targeted engagement

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis
- Insight communication
- Visualization & storytelling

## Outcome

The analysis generated insights that could inform:
- Inventory restocking frequency
- Marketing strategies for high- or low-spending customers
- Segmentation for loyalty programs or personalized promotions
- Operational strategy decisions like staffing based on spend trends
